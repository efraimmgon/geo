# Criminal Analysis & Geoprocessing

In law enforcement understanding how, where, and when crime happens goes a 
long way to helping prevent similar crimes from happening in the future.

Given that old school manual criminal analysis with Excel tables is very 
boring, and the patterns and repetition present in this task, 
criminal analysis is a great candidate for automation.

By adding geoprocessing to the equation we get a very user friendly system,
as we can crunch an arbitrary chunk of data for the user with only a few inputs

With that we can give him a detailed summary with the statistics he needs 
coupled with a visual representation of those statistics, greatly improving 
his comprehension and decision making.
